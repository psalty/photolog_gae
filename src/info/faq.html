		<p>I am always trying to find a better way to communicate with others.</br>
		As a photographer myself, I am not satisfied with any blogging or board system that currently existing.</br>
		At the same time, as a big fan of Flickr Service, I want to try to use Flickr as a sandbox and wrap a photolog.</br>
		When Goole roled out GAE with python support, I decided to take an action and this is what I made.

		The world of image, you can give inspiration or receive inspiration through a simple image.</br>
		An image is an capture of a moment, and it also has lots of story and imagination.</br>
		That will trigger your intuition and you may want to communicate with image.</br>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		These effort will clearly weave all the imagination via image.

		Let's weave someone's imagination to yours.
